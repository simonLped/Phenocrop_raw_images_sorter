Runs in anaconda promt with: python "SCRIPT_PATH" --input_path "PATH_YOU_WANT_TO_SORT" --fields "FIELDS_SEPERATED_WITH_COMMA"

This script works with the multispectral phantom drone or any path that has the following structure:
Example:
100MEDIA
101FPLAN
102FPLAN
103MEDIA
104FPLAN
105FPLAN
106FPLAN
104MEDIA

The standard procedure is:
- Take picture of book with name of field.
- Take calibration picture.
- Do the flight, land and change battery if needed.
- After you are done taking pictures of the field, take another calibration picture.
- For the next field, start at step one again.

Within folders ending with "FPLAN" there should be only rgb and multispectral images of the field.
Inside folders ending with "MEDIA" there should be only images of the calibration panel, field name, and optional weather picture.
There can not be two "MEDIA" folders right after eachother.

If you have more calibration pictures then 1 before a field, and one after a field you need an additional input
Example:
--cal_pics "2,4"
For 3 fields with 2 calibration pictures after the first field, and 4 calibration picture after the second field.
You do not need to specify calibration pics for the last field, the script includes all calibration pics in the last folder to the correct folder.
With this method you do not need to think about the calibration pictures before each field. Only the ones after you land and take x amount of calibration pics.
